## Introduction

This is a demo project where SignalR is hosted in an IoT Edge module.

The solution consists of:

- datasimulator: an IoT Edge module which simulates telemetry that is being generated.

- notifier: an IoT Edge module that hosts a SignalR endpoint.  The telemetry that is generated by `datasimulator` is exposed by this module.

- TelemetryClient: A console application which represents a client that subscribes to the SignalR endpoint.  The TelemetryClient subscribes to SignalR to receive only telemetry updates of a specific device.
